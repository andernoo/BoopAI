##A neural network with genetic algorithms experiment

###Getting smarter!

###ToDo:
- Improve the crossover function to ensure weights can mutate otherwise the generations become stale and peak at around 12 seconds
- Instead of X/Y control, add rotation and forward controls. Change graphics to have a transform function.
