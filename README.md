# BoopAI
##A neural network with genetic algorithms experiment
There is definately a "peak" of performance which will need addressed, or perhaps they are as fit as they can get? Evolution is strange. 

I will be adding more things for them to do and adapt to, such as teaching them that the walls are bad and giving them more sensors, and physics.

###ToDo:
- Instead of X/Y control, add rotation and forward controls. Change graphics to have a transform function.
- Teach them that the walls are bad, add a sensor to the front that detects physical objects, other boops and food. Or a sensor on all sides? A bump sensor might work.
